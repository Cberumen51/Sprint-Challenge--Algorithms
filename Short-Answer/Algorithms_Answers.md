#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Since the input and the output in the out put are pretty linear with a big incline so it's O(n)


b) Since there are 2 loops in the code the runtime complexcity is O(n^2)


c) O(n) because it goes thought the funcion every time making it a constant function

## Exercise II

I would start off by dividing the n-story by half then dropping an egg. If the egg breaks again. I would go by half again until it doesn't break. Once the egg doesn't break I would slowly go up one floor and drop an egg until the egg breaks again. Since you're diving into the building the run time would be O(logn)
